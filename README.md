The study investigates the influence of financial ratios on UK stock returns, focusing on a sample of 30 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange from 2017 to 2022. It employs quantitative methods, specifically regression analysis, to explore relationships between key financial ratios—such as debt-to-equity ratio, price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), return on equity (ROE), and dividend yield—and stock returns.

Financial ratios are critical tools for investors assessing company performance. The P/E ratio, in particular, stands out for its widespread use in evaluating stock performance, as indicated by Tse and Wong's findings that high P/E ratios correlate with superior stock performance. Similarly, the study underscores the importance of ROE and debt-to-equity ratios in influencing stock returns. These ratios offer insights into profitability and financial leverage, which are pivotal considerations for investors navigating market conditions.

An economic backdrop provided by the COVID-19 pandemic highlights its adverse impact on the banking and finance sectors, affecting liquidity, borrowing capacity, and revenue generation. Such macroeconomic factors underscore the relevance of financial ratios in gauging resilience and adaptability in turbulent times.

Methodologically, the study employs panel data analysis, leveraging financial data sourced from diverse platforms including financial institutions and stock exchanges. This approach enables a comprehensive examination of how variations in financial ratios across different sectors—banking, finance, and non-finance—impact stock returns.

The analysis aims to validate the hypothesis that financial ratios significantly influence UK stock returns. By conducting regression analysis and hypothesis testing, the study seeks to quantify these relationships and determine their statistical significance. Such insights are crucial for investors seeking to make informed decisions based on empirical evidence rather than conjecture.

In conclusion, the research underscores the importance of financial ratios in guiding investment decisions, offering a robust framework for evaluating stocks within the UK market. By delineating the impact of key ratios on stock performance, the study equips stakeholders with actionable insights to navigate market volatility and capitalize on opportunities presented by varying economic conditions.



The study hypothesizes that financial ratios such as debt-to-equity ratio, price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), return on equity (ROE), and dividend yield significantly affect UK stock returns from 2017 to 2022. Regression analysis will be used to quantitatively examine these relationships, aiming to determine the degree of impact and statistical significance of each ratio on stock performance in the UK market.
